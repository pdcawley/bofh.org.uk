This got uploaded to soundcloud a couple of weeks ago, but I uploaded it late on the Sunday before OSCON and then forgot to post something here as well. Anyway, this is a belting old hymn that I first heard sung by a chap called Derek, when I was living in Northampton and going to the "Soles and 'Eels" folk club. I finally got the words down from a fabulous recording, done for a Fellside anniversary compilation, by the combined forces of Swan Arcade, the Watersons and (seemingly) everyone who ever recorded for Fellside.
