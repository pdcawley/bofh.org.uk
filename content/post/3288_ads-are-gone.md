Back when I was writing the occasional "How do you find me?" article, I would get some weird ads showing up. On one occasion, I commented that the searcher had obviously just typed a homework question into google and expected an answer. All the ads on that page ended up being for sites that would write your essays for you.

"Hmm..." I thought, "That's not good.", and set about adding those advertisers to the block list.

Then, in another article, I ranted about those, ah, bastions of democracy (thank you, Tom Lehrer) who indulge in comment spamming and found myself advertising them.

[Rolling back the enlightenment](http://www.bofh.org.uk/articles/2006/10/16/rolling-back-the-enlightenment) which discussed, amongst other things, my Uncles' marriage after 36 years together (yay!) attracted some pretty dodgy ads too.

To my shame, none of these made me rethink the advertising, I just extended the filter and shook my head at the unpleasantness of it all.

The straw that broke the camel's back was the advertising around [Fat is an economic issue](http://www.bofh.org.uk/articles/2008/04/12/fat-is-an-economic-issue) ran utterly counter to the spirit of the of the article, and they were like "whack a mole". Every time I extended the filter, another ad for another bloody health insurance leech or some other snake oil peddler popped up.

So, screw that, the Google ads are gone - it's not as if they were making me a huge amount anyway. I'll continue with the left margin Amazon links though - nobody ever buys anything I recommend, but I like the pictures.
