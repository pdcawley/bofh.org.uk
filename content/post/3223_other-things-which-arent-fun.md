Last year, you would have been forgiven for thinking that Typo was pretty much dead in the water as an ongoing project. [Typosphere](http://www.typosphere.org/) was a placeholder, changes were few and far between, the app was a bloated monster. So, people switched, in droves, to [Mephisto](http://www.mephistoblog.com/) the new, (and excellent) kid on the block. Heck, even [Tobi](http://blog.leetsoft.com/), the original author of Typo, has switched.

Mephisto's a great piece of software, and I'm as sure as I can be (without taking a closer look) that its underpinning code is cleaner than typo's. When you're developing on a rapidly moving platform like Ruby on Rails, there could be said to be a second mover advantage - the later you start, the more likely Rails is to already do what you want, and the less likely you are to zag where Rails later zigs.

However, [Rick](http://www.technoweenie.com/) and [Justin](http://alternateidea.com/) have other projects and demands on their time, and once something is Good Enough, it's hard to summon up the motivation to make it better until you find something that *you* want your application to do.

So now, as Typo comes out of hibernation, it seems that Rick and Justin have been getting it in the neck because their project is '[stalled](http://www.mephistoblog.com/2007/3/22/is-mephisto-dead'). Okay, so I admit, I did smile ruefully to myself when I read that.

Then I read the comments. Wow. Some people have some serious entitlement issues.

It's been said before, it'll be said again I'm sure: if you don't like something about an open source project, "Patches welcome!". If your patches are repeatedly rejected: it's open source, fork off. If a project is moribund: offer to help.

Complaints just put people's backs up.

I think it's great that there's choices available if you want a blog built Rails. Different perspectives on a problem space are important - if nothing else, everyone gets to steal from each other, everyone's apps get better and everybody wins.
