This evening, I acquired a commit bit for the [Typo](http://typo.leetsoft.com/) project. I've been chucking the occasional big patch and ideas at [Scott Laird](http://scottstuff.net/), the most active of the current maintainers, but he's been busy doing all sorts of stuff, and he just started working at [Google](http://www.google.com/) (go Scott!) so he doesn't have quite as much copious free time as before.

So, this evening I asked for, and received, my very own commit bit. Which means I can make changes to Typo without needing to funnel them through a maintainer -- I'm now part of the funnel.

Of course, responsible programming means I'll still run big changes by Scott and the other maintainers, but it's also useful to be able to make the kind of small changes that sometimes need to be made without it blocking on a busy man.

Wish me luck.
