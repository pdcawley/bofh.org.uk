Do you know [Soundpost](http://www.soundpost.org.uk)? They're awesome. In
March 2011 I (and everyone else on
the [Royal Traditions](http://royaltraditions.co.uk) mailing list I suspect)
got some email from [Fay Hield](http://fayhield.com) talking about her "exciting
plans" to run a "weekend of singing workshops, talks and socialising with some
of the finest and most thought provoking singers on the English folk scene."
and wanted to gauge interest and suggestions as to what sort of sessions we'd
be interested in.

I wrote back with suggestions and a bucket of enthusiasm. Fay's reply was
lovely

Those exciting plans turned into the first Dungworth Singing Weekend. It was
magical. Great singers, fine singing in the Royal and thought provoking
discussion and teaching. Serious, but far from po-faced. That was Soundpost's
first event and they've been delivering enjoyable and stimulating events ever
since.

[Arts Emergency](http://arts-emergency.org) makes badges which read "sometimes if you
want something to exist you have to make it yourself". The beauty of Soundpost
is that I can
make [something else I want to exist](https://singingtogether.co.uk) because
Fay,
[Jon](http://jonboden.com),
[Sam](http://www.samsweeneymusic.com), [Andy](http://magicandy81.tumblr.com)
and co. have already made Soundpost and it's wonderful.

There is a new folk revival going on and organizations like Soundpost are
welding the best of the old and the new together and building something which
will last; a community of musicians and singers, supporting each other and
welcoming the world in to a music that can seem cliquey and stand-offish to
newcomers. More power to their collective elbow.
