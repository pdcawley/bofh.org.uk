Yay! Not only have we released [Typo 4.0.0](http://scottstuff.net/blog/articles/2006/07/22/typo-4-0-0) at last (big news: massively improved feedback spam protection and much, much easier installation), but I've brought this blog back to the bleeding edge (complete with further improved feedback management).

I was about to say that most of the changes are only visible to the blog administrator, but that's probably because I've been developing it; you don't really notice the changes when you're making them in fairly small steps. There are reader visible changes, mostly in the sidebars over on the right, all sorts of goodies there compared to the last release.
