My D200 didn't arrive on the 15th of December. Jacobs are blaming Nikon, Nikon are probably blaming Jacobs. To compound my error, I took the D100 down to the Mill for Christmas, but forgot to take the battery charger. So, no Christmas photos from me.

Which is a good thing. The problem with taking a camera to parties is that the camera turns me from a participant into an observer. Sometimes, being an observer is great; other times, not so much.

So, a cracking Christmas was had by all and there will be no embarrassing photos. (Although there were a couple of moments when I wished I could have pulled my trusty Ricoh GR1 out of my pocket and snapped the kids who continue to be exceedingly cute.)
