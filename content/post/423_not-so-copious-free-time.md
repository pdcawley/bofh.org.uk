So, I'm now working 2 days a week as a [Ruby on Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.com/) programmer for [Bluefountain](http://www.bluefountain.com/) and, whilst it's great fun to be back working again, it doesn't half eat into my free time.

I had intended to get a Perl 6 Summary written on Monday or Tuesday, but I spent most of Monday in bed with a stinking cold and most of Tuesday doing a bunch of House Stuff, and before I know it I'm off to Liverpool...

So, if you've been waiting on a summary, I'm really sorry; it shouldn't happen again.
