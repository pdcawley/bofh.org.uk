For years I've managed to dodge learning JavaScript. People have told me it's a fine language with some dodge implementations. Friends have built an entire [business model](http://www.zimki.com/) in the language, and I've continued to treat as if it were The Sound of Music (I'm 39 now and I have managed to completely avoid watching that film).

Except, today I finally had a technical need that I couldn't dodge by writing another `.rjs` file, so with the help of the [Prototype](http://www.prototypejs.org/) docs, a [helpful article](http://www.crockford.com/javascript/private.html) or two and healthy dose of cribbing from others, I was off.

What do you know, it really is a fine language. I doubt I'm writing idiomatic code though - I'm leaning heavily on closures and private member functions, and I haven't written a single `for` loop yet, but it seems to accommodate my style.

Now, if I can just get my head round the innards of keyboard events I shall be a great deal happier.
