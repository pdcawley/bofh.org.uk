I've been catching up with James Duncan Davidson's [blog](http://blog.duncandavidson.com/) and [one entry](http://blog.duncandavidson.com/2006/08/damian_conway.html) caught my eye, coming as it did with a fabulous black and white photograph of [Damian Conway](http://damian.conway.org/)

It's a fabulous photograph. Gorgeous light, great composition, lovely. (Being an old film fart, I do miss the grain though. Digital noise just isn't the same). It's also a great example of why candid portraiture is so good; it would take a fair amount of skill, to get lighting like this deliberately.

Damian's a great photographic subject. Being all ego, I was reminded of the photos I took at EuroOSCON last year. If I had to pick a top 5 then one of 'em would definitely be of Damian. Possibly even if I had to pick a top 3.

But, on looking at those again, I think the one of Paula Le Dieu just edges it.

Also, if you don't know what James Duncan Davidson looks like, here he is rigged out in full on professional photographer mode:
