A friend of mine, David Morton, just pointed me at a [transcript](http://www.musekids.org/musicking.html) of a lecture given by one Christopher Small. In it Small *nails* something I've been trying to articulate for ages. I don't know whether to applaud madly or seethe with silent resentment that someone said it so much better, and in 1995 at that.

On balance, I'm applauding. Read it, it's worth it for Opera story alone.
