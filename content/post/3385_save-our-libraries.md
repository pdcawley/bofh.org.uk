So, on Saturday, the opening line, and pretty much the entire tune, of a song banged on my head as we went to our local Library to fill our boots with books and generally get with the "Save our Libraries" message. Here it is. Sing it out. Sing it loud.

### A Child of the Library

**Chorus:**  
I'm a Child of the Lib'ry, it made me who I am,  
It taught me about freedom and the fellowship of Man  
A sea of story waits for you behind the lib'ry door,  
Don't say we can't afford them any more.  

The Lib'ry's where I made some friends I've known my whole life through  
The Walkers and the Blacketts and the Pevensies so true.  
Simp the canine cannonball, Galadriel the fair.  
The daughter of a pirate king and Paddington the Bear  

I've travelled South with Shackleton and all his gallant crew  
And to the African interior that Mary Kingsley knew  
I've rode the trackless prairie where the bison used to roam  
An travelled round the Universe, not half an hour from home.  

And as I grew the libr'y fed my curiosity,  
All there for the asking. All of it for free.  
It's there I found the stories that I couldn't find at home.  
It's where I learned I was myself and not my father's clone.  

So make friends with your library, don't let it fade away.  
Teach your kids the lib'ry's where you go on Saturday.  
Don't let the bastards tell you they will cost to much to save  
While they're shovelling our taxes down the hole the bankers made  

So make a stand for the lib'ry. Stand up while you can.  
Stand up for your freedom. Stand for your fellow man.  
Ignorance is never bliss, don't close the lib'ry door.  
For a lib'ry lost is lost forever more.

#### Notes and Updates

Mike Whitaker has worked out a set of chords for this, if you're happier singing with a guitar. Frankly, instrumentation scares me, I'm much happier singing unaccompanied but I realise I'm in a minority on this.

When you sing it, try making the song your own by changing things to suit your own. Julie Chilton's posted an alternate first verse in the comments, but the world is the mollusc of your choice.

The 'I' in the song, isn't *quite* me and it isn't quite Gill either. Most importantly, both of us grew up in houses where no book was out of bounds. Our fathers used to take us to our respective local libraries (Lewisham for Gill, Doncaster Central and then Bawtry for me) every week or so on a Saturday morning. As soon as I was old enough, I'd ride my bike from our home in Scrooby to Bawtry with a carrier full of books hanging off the handlebars. Bawtry is currently in the crosshairs of Doncaster's idiot mayor - the bloke who suggested getting kindles for everyone instead - along with 13 other libraries in the district.

There's a revised version of the recording with additional notes at: [A Child of the Library, revised](http://www.bofh.org.uk/2011/04/04/a-child-of-the-library-revised), or just press play:

##### August 9th 2011

I've updated the lyrics here to reflect what I sing now. A few of the clumsier bits have been fixed. Hopefully there will be video from my performance at OSCON 2011, which has the 'right' lyrics.
