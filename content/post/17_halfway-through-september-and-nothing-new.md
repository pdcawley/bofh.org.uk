And there's nothing new in this post really. I've been indulging myself in a gadget buying spree including finally getting myself a decent film scanner and starting to get some of my old negatives and slides scanned in. I'll be putting more stuff online as time goes on, but for the time being here's a few photos from [Silverstone](/photos/Silverstone/) a couple of years ago.

I've also finally bought myself a digital camera, in theory so I can't use the 'but film/dev costs so much!' excuse. Asking how much the camera, power grip and decently short lens are going to cost me is, of course, beside the point. [Here](http://homepage.mac.com/pdcawley/PhotoAlbum1.html) is an album of photos that will mostly be be of interest to my family. The [last one](http://homepage.mac.com/pdcawley/.Pictures/Photo%20Album%20Pictures/2003-09-12%2004.19.30%20-0700/Image-8B5395A4E51211D7.jpg) is probably decent even if you're not related to the subject though.
