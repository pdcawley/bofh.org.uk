Okay, so I know GUI coding's a pain in the bum. I know that the windows libraries aren't the most friendly. I know it's not fair to point and laugh.

But... -&gt; [IronPython Hello World Tutorial](http://www.learningpython.com/2006/10/02/ironpython-hello-world-tutorial/)

Bwah hah ha ha.

Of course, I don't doubt that huge amounts of the boilerplate hoopage in the code shown can, and will, be abstracted away. But right now it's just painful.

IronPython's one hell of an achievement though. If there's any justice in the world, it deserves to get out there and kick C\#'s arse good and proper, at least in the .NET context. But still.
