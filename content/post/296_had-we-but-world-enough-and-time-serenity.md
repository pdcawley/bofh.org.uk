Joss Whedon's Firefly was a sf series that was never given time; episodes were jumbled by the network and the show got cancelled just when it was starting to build a serious fanbase. And that's all she wrote.

Except, as fans of Buffy and Angel know, Joss Whedon doesn't tell the same stories as everyone else. He managed to hold his cast together and found the funding to make Serenity. It isn't quite the film of series they didn't have time to make, but it comes close.

Capsule review: I liked it. I liked it a lot. You should see it.

For a slightly longer, and possibly spoilery review, kindly step behind this curtain...
