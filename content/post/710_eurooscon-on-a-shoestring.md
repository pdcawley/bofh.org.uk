"Good news! Those lovely people at [Fotango](http://www.fotango.com/), grateful for the use of the [photo of their MD](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pdcawley/54446205) I took, have offered to pay for a EuroStar ticket to Brussels for EuroOSCON."

"Bad news! I still can't afford to stay in a hotel."

So I'm going to play the shamelessly cheeky bugger card. If any of you fine readers is going to EuroOSCON and has a hotel room floor/unused half of a twin room/sofa where I can crash, then I would be *delighted* to hear from you.
