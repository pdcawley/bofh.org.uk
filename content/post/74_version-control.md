The trouble with version control systems is that, if you're not careful, it's almost as bad as having no version control at all. I'm currently juggling about 4 active branches of typo: the local development branch, the production branch and a couple of branches that isolate some of the local changes so I can make clean patches for the typo developers.

So far, I've managed to upload about 5 patches, and I'm *still* not sure if the patches that are up on the [Typo tracker](http://typo.leetsoft.com/) are sane. And back porting the clean new system's been a complete nightmare.

Still, it could be worse. I could be still trying to understand the inner workings of Moveable Type.
