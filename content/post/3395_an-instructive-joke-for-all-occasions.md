Two bulls were grazing at the bottom of the big pasture, when the farmer let a load of heifers in at the top gate.

"Hey," said the young bull to the old, "What do you say we run up there and fuck us a couple of heifers?"

"Well," said the old one, "You're welcome to do that if you want to, but I plan on walking up there and fucking all of them".

I'll leave any interpretation up to you.
