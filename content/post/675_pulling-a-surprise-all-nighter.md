Guess who couldn't sleep?

So, I've been productive and have ported 9 Typo sidebars to the new, controller free, sidebar architecture. Sadly, it's not something I can write a program to do, but the work involved is still fairly minor.

It's still a spike though; once I've done the other 20, I need to work out how to get their views into the plugin directory as well.

Still, progress is good.
