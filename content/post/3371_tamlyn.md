Ah, Tamlyn, one of the 'muckle sangs' appropriate to this time of year. This isn't the first time I've recorded this and put it online, but I lost the original AIFF files and Bandcamp doesn't accept lossy files.

So, rather late for Halloween, I've rerecorded it.

This is the first time I've broken my 'one take' rule - when you're singing a 10 minute long song and you cock it up 7 minutes in (for the second time), you tend to think "Sod it! I'll fix it in post" so here it is - with only the grossest errors covered up.

I got the bones of this from [Pete Morton's](http://www.petemorton.com) version on "Frivolous Love", but it's been modified somewhat by hearing Mike Waterson's take on it (which seems to have informed Pete as well) and I found the pair of verses involving the "old grey knight" on [Mudcat](http://www.mudcat.org/) and thought that they help make Margaret a little less of a doormat and more the kind of strong willed independent woman that's depressingly rare in folk songs.
