It's the first week in August. As soon as I finished my programming work, I
drove down to Sidmouth for a couple of days of folkie immersion.

There's not all that much to say. I didn't get to bed before 2am each night. I
sang a bunch of songs in good company. I listened to a bunch more and spent an
evening singing old chestnuts, meeting house songs and school hymns with
[Sheila Kay Adams](http://www.sheilakayadams.com), Carol Anderson[^1] and a
brilliant crowd in the garden of the Swan. Magic.

Tune in next week for more bakehouse related bakehouse diary.

[^1]: A amazing Scots fiddler and singer who doesn't have a website. If you want to
    know what she sounded like 6 years ago, seek out the fabulously titled
    [Single track road trip](http://www.livingtradition.co.uk/webrevs/ltcd5001.htm).
    She's only getting better though.
