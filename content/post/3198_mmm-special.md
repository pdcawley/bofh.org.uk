Some months ago, I ordered a pizza from Papa John's using their web interface (I'm not proud, I'll admit to the occasional need for junk food). The pizza was terrible (since then I've only ever used them for a satsifying late night cravings for Ben and Jerry's when I can't be arsed to go to the all night Tesco's).

They still send me junk email. Today's took the cake:

Because nothing says "you're special" like a half price Papa John's pizza.
