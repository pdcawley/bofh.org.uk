You probably don't know this yet, but I'm in the process of preparing a course on Test Driven Development & Refactoring with Perl which I hope will find me some favour and income.

One of the trickier aspects, daft as it sounds, is finding a good problem to use for the course. Ideally you need something that you can see measurable improvement in as the code is developed, and a well defined set of requirements. One of the standard problems I've come across is that of scoring 10-pin bowling.
