I'm reading ??[Beautiful Code](amazon:0596510047??) and it's very good indeed. However, you have to feel sorry for [Tim Bray](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing) - his chapter, "Finding Things" is excellent, as you'd expect. The only problem is, he's following [Jon Bentley](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Bentley), author of that perennial classic, [Programming Pearls](amazon:0201657880). It's been a while since I (re)read anything by Bentley and I'd forgotten how good his *prose* was.

Which isn't to say that Tim Bray is a bad writer. Far from it. It's just that Jon Bentley is a very good one indeed.

Apart from that, Beautiful Code is a cracking book so far, and the royalties go to [Amnesty International](http://www.amnesty.org/). You should buy a copy.
