Rails routing is making my head hurt. It's starting to remind me of the guts of perl's regular expression engine, which was said to be understood by three people, plus or minus five.

I just want to write routes like `/articles/:art[year]/:art[month]/:art[mday]/:art[slug]`.

I'm seriously considering starting again from scratch, which can't be right.
