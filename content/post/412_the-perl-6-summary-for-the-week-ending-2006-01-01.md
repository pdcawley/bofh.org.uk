Another year, another summary. You might think I'm going to summarize
the events of the whole year, but it turns out that chromatic's
already done it. So in the spirit of laziness, I'll just point you at
his year end summary.

<http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/8894>

Sadly for us all, he doesn't go into enough detail on the events of
the last week for me to go straight into the coda. I shall have to
talk to him about next year.

This week sees a big non-technical change in the Pugs camp, lots of
roadmapping and implementation in the Parrot camp, and a more and more
concrete feel of what the language is going to look like in the
perl6-language camp.

Pretty much business as usual really.
