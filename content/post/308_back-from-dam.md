Well, I'm back from EuroOSCON, which was a pile of fun. I spent most of my time on the 'hallway track', occasionally dropping in on interesting talks and keynotes, but mostly just hanging around with interesting people. I took a pile of [photos](http://flickr.com/photos/pdcawley/tags/eurooscon/) and still have a couple of rolls of film left to develop now I'm back home.

If you're in Amsterdam and need a professional lab, allow me to recommend [Kleurgamma](http://www.kleurgamma.com/english/). It's always a little nerveracking taking negatives to a new lab, but they were exemplary. And they had some fantastic images hanging in their lobby...

Expect more articles about/inspired by the conference soonish.
