Well, today's been fun. For appropriate values of fun. I've fought shy of doing politics in this blog so I'm not going to rant about the evils of theism, nationalism, Bush, Blair, Hizbullah, Israeli foreign policy, eejits who plot to blow up aeroplanes or any of the other things you'd expect a [soggy liberal](http://perlmonger.livejournal.com/82052.html) like me to get exercised about. Life's too short.

Instead, I'm here to tell Tim Bray that he's wrong. And I can prove it.
