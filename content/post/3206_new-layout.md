You may have noticed I've been tweaking. The new layout is based on Scribbish with a few CSS tweaks and some low cunning to get the three column layout working.

The basic font set is drawn from the new fonts that come with Vista: Body text is in Calibri, headings are mostly in Candara. I can't say I'm a fan of Vista - I type this in a Windows free house - but the new font set is gorgeous. (I've put information on getting them installed without Vista below the fold.)

What do you think?

#### Update

Thanks to Simon Pride for pointing out how ugly things looked in safari - I've hopefully sorted out the leading issues now.
