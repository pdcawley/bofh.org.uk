So, I just read the latest phishing attempt. Someone purporting to be <a href="http://www.paypal.com">Paypal</a> tells me that someone else has sent me Ã‚Â£12. Which would be lovely, if true.

However, a cursory inspection of the HTML source shows that it's a scam site. Lovely.

Interestingly, the mail refers to images served by Paypal. If I were paypal, or any of the other online money handlers come to that, I'd be seriously considering tweaking my image servers to return "The page you are currently looking at is probably a scam" type images to any request that doesn't come with the appropriate referer and/or cookie. Sure, it uses up processor cycles, but I'm guessing that processor cycles are cheaper than fraud.

Just a thought.
