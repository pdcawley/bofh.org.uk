Are you reading Mark Dominus's [Universe of Discourse](http://newbabe.pobox.com/~mjd/blog/?) and if not, why not?

Mark's one of the cleverest and most entertaining guys I've ever met; if you get a chance to attend one of his courses, you really should do it. Your mind will be expanded. Which is by the by, but hey.

The reason I bring this up is that Mark started an occasional series of articles discussing some of the 'interesting' queries that show up in his server logs, and he gets some pretty spiffy queries - if I ever get a query as interesting as "if n + 1 are put inside n boxes, then at least one box will contain more than one ball. prove this principle by induction" I think I'll print out the log report and frame it. And how can you not love a blog that somebody found by searching for "consciousness torus photon core"?

Which is a roundabout way of saying I'm about to pinch Mark's idea and attempt a pale imitation of it here.
