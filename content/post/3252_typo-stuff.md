If you've been running on the [Typo](http://www.typosphere.org/) edge recently, you'll be all too painfully aware that there have been issues with the cache being flushed at the wrong times and not flushed at all at others. Which is not a happy state of affairs.

However, I've recently got back to working on Typo and, after a few warmup refactorings and some missteps, I think caching is working properly now.

There's lots more work to do (there always is) but I reckon that you could do worse than bump your installation to r1513, which is what I'm running here.
