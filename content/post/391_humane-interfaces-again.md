A [friend](http://codepope.blogspot.com/) just popped up on IRC and pointed me to one of Elliote Rusty Harold's [contributions](http://www.cafeaulait.org/oldnews/news2005December8.html) to the humane interfaces debate that was sparked by Martin Fowler's [post](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/HumaneInterface.html) on the subject. I didn't recognize the URL and ended up rereading it.

As I did so, I suddenly realised that yes, Harold does have a point, but that he's missing another one that seems rather more important to me.
