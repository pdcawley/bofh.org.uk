I find myself thinking of the old joke about Sheepshagger John:

A man goes into a pub in a small town and, for whatever reason, gets introduced to the clientele. There's Farmer Jack, Barman Jim, Maurice "Dancer" and Sheepshagger John. After a few pints, the visitor's curiosity gets the better of him and he asks John what's with the nickname.

"See this pub?" asks John, "I built it, but they don't call me Pubbuilder John? I'm the local doctor, I saved Barman Jim's life once when he choked on a peanut, but they don't call me Lifesaver John. Every year, I supply a huge Christmas tree for the village green, but the don't call me Christmas Tree John.

"But you shag one lousy sheep..."

Why am I reminded of this?
