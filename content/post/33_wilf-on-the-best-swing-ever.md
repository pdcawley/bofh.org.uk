In the garden of my parents' house is a big old willow tree. Attached to a branch some 30 or 40 feet up is this swing, which swings out over a tiny stream. Because the swing is actually attached to a block and tackle, it's possible, once you have the knack to keep it swinging (and indeed increase the swing's amplitude) by judiciously shortening and releasing the rope.

This is, truly, the swing of the gods.

One day, when my nephews Bert and Wilf are older, they'll realise this. Until then it's just the best fun ever.
