This year's [EuroOSCON](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/euos2006/) had no lightning talks scheduled. Then, late on Wednesday night, I noticed that a talk had been cancelled. Aha! I thought. I asked around a few people I knew who normally go for the lightning thing, got a critical mass of interested parties, went and found [Nat](http://radar.oreilly.com/nat/) and we were good to go.

And it was good. Even if we hadn't organized the session at less than 12 hours notice it would have been good.

I gave a talk on having your photograph taken that I'd delivered at EuroFOO; Russ Nelson showed us his prototype Bluetooth chording keyboard, [BooK](http://perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=21732) had a fabulous series of sensationalist magazine covers showing what *really* goes on at YAPC::Europe; [Gerv Markham](http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/gerv/) gave a 45 minute talk on [Phishing: Conning the Unwary For Fun and Profit](http://www.gerv.net/presentations/lugradio2005/) in 5 minutes; [Ewan Spence](http://www.ewanspence.com/blog/) gave out some Podcasting tips (and recorded the whole thing); Suw Charman of the [Open Rights Group](http://www.openrightsgroup.org) talked about the ORG; [Damian Conway](http://damian.conway.org/) managed (just) to get through the 101 things he loves about Perl 6; [Jesse Vincent](http://www.fsck.com/) did a talk he'd written that morning about a script he'd written two days before. And... I probably missed someone out.

Excellent talks all. Thank you people, we'll have to do it again some time.

Looking at James Duncan's [photos](http://flickr.com/photos/x180/tags/eurooscon06) from the session, it seems I missed out [Dennis Kaarsemaker](https://launchpad.net/people/dennis), but for the life of me, I can't remember what he talked about.
