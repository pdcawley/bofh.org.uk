On the last day of EuroOSCON there was a panel discussing why there were so few women in the open source community. It turns out that the predictable claim that "It's the same throughout the industry, it's not an Open Source only problem!" doesn't really stand up. [Danese Cooper](http://danesecooper.blogs.com/divablog/) pointed to a study that found that 12% of all developers were women, but only 2% of Open Source developers are.
