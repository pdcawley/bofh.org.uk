As I write, [Typo Themes Contest](http://www.typogarden.org/) is in that nervous interlude that comes between the last day for entries and the judges' announcement of fabulous prizes (I haven't totted up the value of the prize fund, but there's a Powerbook and an iBook for first and second place) for the winners.

So, if you're one of the entrants busily chewing your fingernails down to the quick as you anxiously await the news of your shiny new powerbook, I have a request:

Please take the time to write a post mortem of your experience of writing your theme. What was good? What wasn't? What really pissed you off about Typo? What documentation did you wish was available?

When you've written it, post it somewhere and either comment or send a trackback ping to this message. I promise that I'll read every such postmortem I hear about. Feedback on this stuff is important to making sure that Typo theme engine is easy to use and well documented in the future -- I'm a coder not a designer; what's intuitive to me isn't necessarily intuitive to you and vice versa. And where interfaces are concerned, user expectation usually trumps developer expectation.
