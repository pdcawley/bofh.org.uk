One of the great things that the internet allows us all to do with music is to share it. I don't mean 'sharing' copyrighted material that we have 'liberated' from the media we purchased it on - I know enough struggling folk musicians to realise how important royalties are to those people.

What I mean by sharing is sharing the music we make ourselves.
