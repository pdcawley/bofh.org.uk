Doesn't time fly when there's nothing much you can be doing? Right now we're
pretty much where we are back in week three, except that Dad is slowly
progressing on building the lifting frame which we're going to use to
reassemble the deck oven in my garage so I can finish the process of either getting
the rust off the soles, or replacing them with 'stone'. Apparently steel has
been ordered so it's just a matter of time.<!--more-->

The final bakehouse site is still lined up and it should be possible to sort
out the 3-phase and plumbing in there quickly once we're definitely ready to
pull the trigger on moving the oven in. So, yes... right now we're twiddling
our fingers.

Meanwhile, the
first
[Singing Together Night](https://singingtogether.co.uk/gig/2016/09/01/paul-and-liz-davenport/) at
the [Doncaster Brewery & Tap](http://doncasterbrewery.co.uk/) went really
well. We sang a lot of songs and Ian, the landlord sold a lot more beer than
he usually does on a Thursday night so we're chalking that up as a success. If
you find yourself in or near Doncaster on next Thursday we're presenting the
fabulous
[Cath and Phil Tyler](https://singingtogether.co.uk/gig/2016/10/06/cath--phil-tyler/).
You should come and listen.
