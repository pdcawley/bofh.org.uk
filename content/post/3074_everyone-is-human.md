Why do people have to be human with *my* new computer?

You would think that arriving home and opening up a brown cardboard box and pulling out a shiny new 15" MacBook Pro 2.16GHz would be a fine thing wouldn't you?

It's rather less than fine when what you'd paid for was a 17" MacBook Pro 2.33GHz.

Annoyingly, it turns out that this wasn't a case of someone in the local store pulling the wrong box from the stockroom. That would be easy to fix. Instead, it turns out that someone in Northampton had a moment of humanity and mislabeled the box - the stockroom monkeys in my local branch have apparently checked the apple labels of all the MacBooks in the shop to no avail.

Apparently the nearest real one in the store network is in Sheffield. Assuming that's not also subject to humanity in Northampton.

Bugger. No new toy until at least Tuesday.

### But why the new computer now?

I'm in the process of setting up a new, photography related, business and, good as my G4 Powerbook is, it can't run Aperture, which is a key part of the game plan, hence the new kit.

Watch this space for details; I shall of course post more once I've got the new website up.
