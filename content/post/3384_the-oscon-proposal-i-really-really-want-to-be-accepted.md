### Open Ears, Open Mind, Open Mouth. Music Making Made Easy

#### Blurb

Our bodies are the most versatile and sophisticated musical instrument we know. From the complexities of making at beat with our hands and feet to the surprising simplicity of harmony singing, we are all of us musicians.

#### Abstract

Musicmaking isn't some kind of sophisticated profession that requires the intervention of gatekeepers and techno priests. You don't need autotune, you don't need a record label, you don't need drums, a guitar or anything else but your hands, feet, ears, brain and mouth to make music that will satisfy you for the rest of your life.

By the end of this talk I promise that, unless you are one of a tiny, tiny minority of people, you'll not be tone deaf, you'll be damn near pitch perfect. And you'll have a song in your head that, unless I have seriously misjudged the people who come to OSCON, you'll want to teach to everyone you know.

Come along. Clap your hands. Stamp your feet and sing. What have you got to lose?
