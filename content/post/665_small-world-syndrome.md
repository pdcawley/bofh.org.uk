We're in the process of doing up our house. Which means that there's a bunch of stuff that we need to get rid of that's not really good enough to [ebay](http://www.ebay.co.uk), but a wee bit too good/big to chuck in the bin.

So, we joined our local [Freecycle](http://www.freecycle.org/) group. It's great, we offer stuff that we can't use and people come and take it away for us. Occasionally, someone else offers something that we can't resist. Spiffy.

Today, we freecycled a fireplace and some wooden CD racks and had them immediately taken by a [Brenda](http://flickr.com/photos/brendadada/), a [Flickr](http://flickr.com/) friend of mine, and [Cath Tyler](http://www.cathtyler.net/), who is involved with [NEOG](http://neog.care4free.net/) - suppliers of our weekly veg box - and is a fine singer and a regular at the [Cumberland Arms](http://www.thecumberlandarms.co.uk/) singing sessions.
