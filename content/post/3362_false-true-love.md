Right, this is the 'real' song for today.

I got this from the singing of [Cath Tyler](http://www.myspace.com/cptyl), who used to be Cath Oss for those of you who remember [Cordelia's Dad](http://www.cordeliasdad.com/).

Like so many of the songs I sing, the motivation to learn this came from a single line "I ain't got a moment of time". I don't know why it should be this particular line - in a song chock full of fantastic images - that hooked me the first time I heard Cath sing it in the bar of the [Cumberland Arms](http://www.thecumberlandarms.co.uk/) in Byker, but I've been listening to and meaning to learn it for years. (You can buy Cath's version [here](http://xrl.us/bhrhm7)).

Then, on Tuesday, I stuck it on "repeat track" on my iPhone, and sang it out (very roughly with a 'wrong' tune) at [Sharps](http://web.ukonline.co.uk/martin.nail/Sharps/SFCintro.htm) that night and again at the [Green Note Cafe's](http://www.greennote.co.uk/) Open Mic night on Wednesday (with something far closer to the actual tune). I sang it into the iPhone this morning and here it is for your listening pleasure. Consider this an early draft. I've got the words and tune pretty solidly now, all that remains is the long process of bedding in. In a few years time it'll feel more like something of mine and less like something I borrowed from Cath.
