'Lady of Autumn', by Beggar's Velvet was one of the earliest influences on my singing as I switched repertoire from the 'plastic Paddy' phase of my early years as a singer (I can still remember songs like the Fields of Athenry and Carrickfergus, I just don't sing them any more). [Dave Webber](http://www.oldandnewtradition.com/daveandanni) is both great singer and a great songwriter and this heartfelt song about the pleasures of nature and the necessity of singing got me right between the eyes and I just had to learn it. There's not much on that album that I haven't had in my repertoire at one time or another over the years, and I heartily recommend you all check it out.

So, although this isn't not traditional, I have sought out and received Dave's permission to put up my recordings of some of his songs here, and this is the first one. Enjoy.
