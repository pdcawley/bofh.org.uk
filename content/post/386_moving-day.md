Today is the first day of our move. We're only going down the road, but we've got a flatload of stuff and a self-store unitload of stuff to amalgamate into one house load of stuff, which means it's going to be a two day process.

With any luck I'll be back online and reading mail on Wednesday morning, but that's subject to BT doing what they're supposed to do. So who knows when I'll be back on the air.

At least the blog's hosted offsite now -- something I've been meaning to do for ages and just never quite got round to before now.

See you all on Wednesday.
