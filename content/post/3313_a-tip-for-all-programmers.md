It doesn't matter what language you program in, there's one very important thing that you should do if you want to get better at your craft.

Read. The. Fucking. Manual.

Seriously. Tutorials are good. Blog articles can be good. Code snippets are probably better than a poke in the eye with a fecally decorated sharp stick.

But the language reference? That's gold. Read the docs. Read the source. Whatever you do, get the fundamentals *down*.
