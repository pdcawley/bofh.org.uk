I'm back on the road after a six month ban for accumulating 12 points. Mum and Dad brought my [Mini Cooper](http://www.mini.co.uk/) up with them when they came for our New Year/housewarming party (which went fabulously well, thanks for asking -- there's still not much to touch making music with friends) and, as the clock struck midnight, the fireworks boomed and the last note of Old lang syne made way to the first note of Happy Birthday, I became a legal driver again.

Hurrah!

Now I just need to get the car serviced, the brake pads replaced and a sensible mount installed for my Christmas satnav and I'll be laughing.
