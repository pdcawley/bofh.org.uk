I just got word from O'Reilly, I've got press accreditation for European Open Source Conference in Amsterdam next month. So I'll be interviewing various Perl 6 luminaries and hopefully summarizing any Perl 6 hackathon activities, doing photojournalistic stuff and generally enjoying the 'hallway track'.

I expect I'll also try and have a word with the Ruby people as well. The last OSCON I went to was a couple of years ago in Portland Oregon. It'll be interesting to see how the European and US versions compare.
