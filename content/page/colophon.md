This site was built with the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site generator, hosted on a [Raspberry Pi](https://raspberrypi.com/) from [Mythic Beasts](https://mythic-beasts.com/).

The theme is a somewhat modified version of the [Tufte CSS](https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css) theme for hugo, originally forked from [shawnohare's repo](https://github.com/shawnohare/hugo-tufte/) with many modifications from [jeremy friesen's](https://takeonrules.com/) fork (which appears to have vanished from github.)

I'm working on making this a fully [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/) enabled site, but the road is long and I keep getting distracted by other shiny things.
