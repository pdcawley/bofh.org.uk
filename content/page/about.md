## Programmer

I've been a Perl programmer for well over 10 years, spent a few years as a Ruby programmer before returning to the Perl fold. I’d like to be a professional Perl 6 programmer one day. There is still hope.

Discovering that you are good at something is wonderful. I was working in Amsterdam on my first programming gig and commuting back to England most weekends. One day, passing through duty free, I bought myself cheapish Nikon SLR, loaded it up with black and white film and was almost immediately hooked. Through the simple expedient of burning lots and lots of film and ruthless editing of contact sheets, I got better at it.

Of the images in the portfolio linked to, only one was taken with that first camera; see if you can guess which one it is.

## Singer

Singing is comfort food for my soul. Singing is something to be shared. And, because I sing traditional songs, I don’t have to worry about licensing issues if I want to distribute any recordings I make.

Traditional songs — free software for the soul.

Pretentious? Moi?

## Cook

Mmm… Chinese food.

## All round geek

Look: I have a weblog; I’ve had the same email address since 1996; I’ve never met the majority of my friends in person; I still read my mail in Emacs; I’d rather spend an evening hacking on the laptop than watching TV. What else could I be?
