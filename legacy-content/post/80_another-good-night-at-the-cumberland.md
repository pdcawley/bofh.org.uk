On Monday, we watched part of No Direction Home, Scorsese's documentary about Bob Dylan. The part that struck me most strongly was an anecdote about the night of the [Cuban Missile Crisis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_missile_crisis).
One interviewee walked into the Gaslight Coffee Shop and found Dylan playing. They ended up singing You're Going to Miss Me When I'm Gone together. About half way through the song, he realised that there was a good chance that there'd be nobody around to miss him.

It occurred to me as I watched, and again last night, that I could think of no better way to spend my last night on Earth than singing and playing with friends. And last night I did exactly that.
