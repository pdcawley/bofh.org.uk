Back in January, I wrote that I was [choosing Perl](http://www.bofh.org.uk/2009/01/12/choosing-a-language-for-2009) to revisit as my language for recreational programming.

Quite a bit has happened since then. I gave [a talk](http://www.bofh.org.uk/2009/05/13/london-pm-presentation) on [MooseX::Declare](http://search.cpan.org/dist/MooseX-Declare) to the London Perl Mongers and will be delivering an [extended version](http://yapceurope2009.org/ye2009/talk/1802) at this year's [YAPC::Europe](http://yapceurope2009.org/ye2009) in August.

Then, a week ago, I accepted an offer to work full time as a Perl programmer again. In London.

Sing "Ho!" for the life of the long distance commuter.
