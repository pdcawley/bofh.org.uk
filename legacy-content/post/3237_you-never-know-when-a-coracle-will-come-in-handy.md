A few years back, we got dad a place on a coracle building course as a birthday present. He had a great time and came back with a half finished coracle that he never quite got round to finishing. Until now, it seems.

Despite what you might think, the photo above isn't taken from inside my parents' boathouse, it's taken from inside their garage. That's not a river, that's the road.

You have to love this June weather don't you?
