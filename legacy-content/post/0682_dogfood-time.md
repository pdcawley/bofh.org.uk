I'll let you into a secret. You can tell when I've done a big `svn up` on this blog simply by looking at the theme. If it's all black and white and sans serif, then it's a racing certainty that I've just done an upgrade which has broken my usual custom theme.

So, later today I shall be sitting down with my local theme repository and bringing things up to speed with all of Scott's changes. Who knows, I might cheat and put back a few helper methods.

### Update

Oops, it seems that there was a bug in the Scribbish theme which meant you couldn't read articles at their permalink...
