In my semi regular trawl of the searches that bring people here, I was surprised to discover that someone had arrived searching for `piers cawley nottingham university`.

What do you know, they probably found the right person.

If you're thinking that I'm more than a little curious about *who* has been searching for me, you'd be right.
