A few of points, I wonder if we can make them join up.

-   The BBC has been making noises about allowing license payers to download a big package of episodes and watch them at their leisure.

-   A month or so ago, having previously said they had no intention of doing so, [Elgato](http://www.bofh.org.uk/) released an API for their EyeTV tuners.

<!-- -->

-   Yesterday, Apple announced a new, slimmer, iMac. Said new iMac comes with a shiny new Media Centre app called Front Row and a remote control.

<!-- -->

-   The iTunes Music Store now sells pop videos and a limited range of TV episodes (in the US).

<!-- -->

-   Apples DRM includes region lockout<sup>[1](http://www.bofh.org.uk/articles/2005/10/13/joining-the-dots#304fn1</sup>)

What could it all mean?
