Gill needs to go to Berlin next week to do some research at the university and the [Ethnological Museum](http://www.smb.spk-berlin.de/smb/sammlungen/details.php?lang=en&objectId=56&n=1&r=4), and it's no fun flying with a CPAP machine and an insulin pen in these paranoid times.

So I shall don my chauffeur's hat and we're taking the ferry from Hull to Rotterdam on Monday night and driving to Berlin. So, if anyone reading this has tips for places to see, restaurants to eat at and all that good stuff, I'd be delighted to hear from you.
