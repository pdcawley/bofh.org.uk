Once upon a time, when the world was still enormously old but I was a good deal younger, a friend with whom I played D&D pressed a copy of Terry Pratchett's <cite asin="0552124753">The Colour of Magic</cite> on me, telling me it was the best thing ever. So off I went and read it and it was indeed the best thing ever.

Well, I was 14 at the time.
