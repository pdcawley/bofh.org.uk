It looks like the iPod Shuffle I bought in a fit of exuberance and silliness not long after it was launched is finally proving its mettle. Because it's so tiny, it happily fits in my waistcoat pocket and supplies me with interesting listening on a boring trip to the place where I'm temping at the moment.

Once I get to work, it gets plugged into a USB socket and I've got a small programming environment with Ruby on Rails and a reasonably competent editor (it's not Emacs, but Emacs is huge.)

Of course, now I want an iPod Nano, but I shall resist.
