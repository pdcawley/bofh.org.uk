There was a session at [EuroOSCON](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/euos06) on 'Music 2.0' and very good it was too. However, during the Q&A, I found myself ranting about how the model of music as product is dead. About the only specific thing I can remember of what I said was "I make music because I must. I record it because it helps me improve. And I distribute it because I can."

If anyone reading this was at the session and can remember what I said in a little more detail, I'd love to hear from you. It's amazing how quickly things fade from the memory.
