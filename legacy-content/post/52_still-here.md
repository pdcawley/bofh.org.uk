Coo... it's been a long time since I said anything here hasn't it? The plan was I was going to write myself a weblog engine as a way of learning Ruby on Rails and have it up in no time flat. Then I got sidetracked by something, I can't remember what. Then I started getting active on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pdcawley/">Flickr</a> and... well. I rather neglected this place.

Expect a couple of new book reviews in the nearish future and who knows, I might even implement the new backend. Watch this space.
