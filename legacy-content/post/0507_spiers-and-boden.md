If you haven't been to see Spiers and Boden yet, you really should. Monday night's gig at the [Cumberland Arms](http://www.thecumberlandarms.co.uk) was fantastic. Great songs and tunes and, just as important, great rapport with the audience. Anyone who can take what's potentially one of the most boring songs in the tradition - The Prickle Eye/Holly Bush and make it a blistering encore piece must be doing something right.
