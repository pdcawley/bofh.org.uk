Exercise 3 in the [Write Your Life](http://www.wgz.org/chromatic/writeyourlife/) project.

On a typical morning, I wake up before the alarm goes at 0630, stumble through into the bathroom, then back into the sitting room where I get suited and booted for the day. (Gill, being a sensible type, gets to sleep in some more, so banging around the bedroom in the dark isn't a particularly good idea). If I'm running to time, I nip into the office, check my mail and skim through my RSS feeds.
