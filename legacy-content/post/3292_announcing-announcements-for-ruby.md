I've just pushed a just about usable (but horribly untested) port of Vassili Bykov's very lovely Smalltalk [Announcements framework](http://www.cincomsmalltalk.com/userblogs/vbykov/blogView?showComments=true&entry=3310034894) onto github. It's a very raw port at the moment (the interface isn't what you'd call idiomatic ruby yet), but I shall be working on that soon. Documentation (beyond a synopsis in the readme file) is nonexistent, but I reckon that there's the core of something useful there (I've got plans for using it in Typo as the basis of a Wordpressesque plugin architecture and I need it for my Sooper Sekrit Project too...).

Expect some more details on the whats and whys in this blog soon, but if you want to have a play, you'll find it at <http://github.com/pdcawley/announcements>. Enjoy.
