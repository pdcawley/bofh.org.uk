Think of this as something of a bonus track. It's not strictly in my repertoire (I had a lyric sheet in front of me while I sang. Shame on me!) but it sits well with the sentiments of <a href="http://www.bofh.org.uk/2010/07/10/rules-of-engagement">my last post</a>.
This version comes from the singing of my wife, Gill Cawley, who started singing it around the time she realised she'd learned it by osmosis. It's somewhat cut down and differs from the original 1861 lyrics, which you'll find on the wikipedia page for the song.
