I'm just about to freeze the database here and turn off comments until DNS changes propagate and Just A Summary returns shiny and new on its new host at [site5](http://www.site5.com/). Hopefully the changes will have propagated before I have to turn the ADSL off here and move everything a quarter of a mile down the road to our new home, but one never knows ones bad luck.

Here's hoping it won't take too long.
