You know, I'm sure, how good fresh baked bread smells. But, good as that smell is, the real pleasure for me is the way it sounds.

I've just pulled a loaf of sourdough bread out of the oven and it's sat in front of me, scenting the air and rustling gently - it shrinks as it cools and that stresses the crust which occasionally gives up the battle with an audible crack. It's an awfully pleasant thing to listen to.

Test Match Special on the radio doesn't hurt either.
