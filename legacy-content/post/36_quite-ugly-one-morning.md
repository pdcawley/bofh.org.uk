Spurred on by the forthcoming adaptation on ITV, I've finally got round to reading Christopher Brookmyre's first novel, <cite asin="0349108854">Quite Ugly One Morning</cite>

Wow.

If you can make it past the (quite disgusting) first chapter, then you'll be in it for the long haul. Great characters, spiky dialogue, twisty plot, worrying prescience and some fabulously gruesome set pieces and comeuppances.

So, in summary. Buy this book. Then do what I did and buy the other Parlabane books too; they're worth it for the titles alone.
