One of the people who make me think that Perl is still worth knowing is chromatic, the ex-editor of O'Reilly's [perl.com](http://perl.com). He's one of the core team who are working to bring the Perl 6 Christmas, a vector of [test infection](http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596100926/index.html), an [extreme programming](http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596004859/) practitioner and, right now at least, no longer on [Giles Bowkett's](http://gilesbowkett.blogspot.com/2009/02/comments-are-back.html) christmas card list.

When I wrote the [Healthcheck: Perl](http://www.h-online.com/open/Healthcheck-Perl-The-Perl-Future--/features/112388) for (oh ghod, they've rebranded) [The H](http://www.h-online.com/), I mentioned that O'Reilly hadn't announced Perl: The Good Parts yet. This was an allusion to something chromatic had said when I interviewed him for the article - at the time he was pitching that very book, but it seems he got knocked back.

So, he's writing a book and a blog on [Modern Perl](http://www.modernperlbooks.com/), and a jolly good blog it is too. It reads like a manifesto in places, but it's a good manifesto, so that's okay. You should read him. If you're a publisher, you should definitely talk to him. If you're a ruby programmer, don't be in the least bit surprised if he's rude about the ruby community...
