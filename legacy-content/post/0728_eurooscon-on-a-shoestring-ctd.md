Mmm... [Priceline](http://www.priceline.co.uk/) doesn't suck does it? I'm now booked into a 4 star hotel about a mile from the conference and it's costing me Â£33 + tax a night. Which is rather better than the best price I found anywhere else (including in the rather splendid sounding Chao Chow Palace on the outskirts of the red light district.

I quite liked the idea of starting my day with noodles and a bowl of Congee.
