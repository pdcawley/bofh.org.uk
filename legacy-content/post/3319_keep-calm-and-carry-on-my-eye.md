This seems like a more appropriate poster somehow:

![Freedom Is In Peril Defend It With All Your Might](/images/freedom.jpg "Freedom Is In Peril Defend It With All Your Might"):http://xrl.us/beqnw4

Can we have this in mugs, t-shirts and other formats please?

Thanks to [Alan Fleming](http://alanfleming.org/2009/03/freedom-is-in-peril/) for pointing it out.
