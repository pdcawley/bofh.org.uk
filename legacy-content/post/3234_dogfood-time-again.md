So, I just pushed the first step of what I'm thinking of as the Great Typo Controller Reorganization to the typo repository and updated things here. It's always scary when I do that - local testing's all very well, but running on a live site is a different matter.

I'll be talking about the changes in a later post, there's a couple of things in the recent change that I'm rather pleased with, as well as a Rails plugin that I hope will be widely useful, but which I need to document.
