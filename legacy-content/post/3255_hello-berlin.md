Well... that was a fun flight. We've missed the Bratwurst on Rails event that the Berlin Ruby folks were putting on, so it's a simple matter of getting some sleep before heading over to the conference hotel at ungodly o'clock to register in time for the first of the Railsconf tutorials.

If anyone knows of a good professional photolab in Berlin that can do black and white film dev + scan overnight, I'd be very interested to hear about it. I've managed to cover the last couple of O'Reilly European conferences in a timely fashion without having to go digital and I don't want to break that record.
