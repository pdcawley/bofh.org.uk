I just got mail to let me know that my copies of <cite asin='0596001738'>Perl Best Practices</cite> and <cite asin='0596100922'>Perl Testing: A Developer's Notebook</cite> are in the post. Yay!

Best Practices runs to 500+ pages, so there's unlikely to be a review up here really quickly, but I just thought I'd give you a heads up. If it's anywhere near as good as Damian's last book[1] it'll be essential.

The testing book should be good too, but I would say that, if only because one of the authors, chromatic, is my editor at [perl.com](http://www.perl.com/). That might get read and reviewed faster; it's a good deal shorter.

I'm off to Glasgow and the World SF Convention for a couple of days, so unless there's wireless goodness, don't expect any posts 'til at least next Monday.

Enjoy your weekend.
