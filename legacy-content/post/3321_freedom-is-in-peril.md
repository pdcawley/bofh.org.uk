I've just written my first 'real' real post for the new [Freedom is in Peril](http://www.freedomisinperil.org.uk/) website. I'll try and keep the political stuff on that blog from now on, but if you're at all concerned about the erosion of what has traditionally, if cornily, been called "British Liberty", then I hope you'll swing by, and link to, the new site.
