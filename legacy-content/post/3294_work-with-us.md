If the last post about our Javascript issues didn't put you off, then you might be interested to know that we're [hiring](http://www.amazingtunes.com/jobs). If you're an experienced, test infected Ruby on Rails programmer with some Javascript and a real world consumer website or two under your belt, and you're happy to work in Newcastle upon Tyne, then we definitely want to hear from you. I'd probably be interested in at least hearing from you if you're an experienced dynamic language programmer who has only recently made (or is considering making) the switch to Ruby and Rails. It's only syntax after all.

The money's decent, the work is interesting, the people (well, apart from me, obviously) are great, and Newcastle's a fantastic city. Drop me a line, ping me on AIM/gTalk/Twitter or just send your CV to the <jobs@amazing-media.com>.
