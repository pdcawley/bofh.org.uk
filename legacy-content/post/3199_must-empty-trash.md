You know I said I was going to [do some work with the Rails routing system](http://www.bofh.org.uk/articles/2007/03/15/cover-me-im-going-in?) And paint my office? And sort out all the crap in Gill's office so she's got a nice place to work?

Well... Civ IV happened.

Wow, I'd forgotten how much of a time sink the Civilization games could be. Frankly it makes World of Warcraft (another game I had to back away from before it took over my life) seem like a mere casual game. (And, yes, I have seen the numbers on how long people will spend playing so called casual games).

So, it's off my hard drive again and I can get back to doing stuff that I actually care about. Normal service is being resumed.
