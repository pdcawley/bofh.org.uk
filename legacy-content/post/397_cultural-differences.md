I just had a moment of clarity. Martin Fowler had a few more <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/DuckInterface.html">things to say</a> about the spat that grew out of his post about [Humane Interfaces](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/HumaneInterface.html) and I suddenly realised *why* java types favour a 'small interfaces and static utility methods on helper classes'. It's because of the way Java interfaces work.
