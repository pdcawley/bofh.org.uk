We're looking for somebody who can make Flash 8 and javascript play well together on IE 6/7, Firefox and Safari. If you fit the bill, please drop me a line at <pdcawley@bofh.org.uk> with a pointer or two to examples of your skills and you, me and my boss will have a nice little talk.

We need a flash application which can be controlled via Javascript - we really don't want to go sticking 10-15 tiny flash buttons on every page if we can help it, just so they can tell the main app (sitting in another window) that the user did something. We have an application that works with Flash 8 and above, but it only works reliably in Firefox. It breaks more or less horribly in IE 6 and 7 and is a wee bit flaky under Safari 2. I haven't a clue how well it plays with Opera.

Now, on a personal site, I'd be reasonably happy to live with Firefox only and maybe Safari 2, but this *isn't* a personal site, so that's out of the window.

So, if you think you fit the bill, or you want to know a bit more about the problem, please drop me a line. Save me from having to learn ActionScript as well, when I barely know Javascript yet.
