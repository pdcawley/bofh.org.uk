Just in case you didn't know, BOFH stands for "Bastard Operator From Hell", a character invented by Simon Travaglia and patron saint of cynical systems administrators everywhere. The original BOFH articles were a lightning rod, used by stressed admins as a way of dealing with idiot lusers. Even if you never acted like the BOFH, you could think "What's your username? ... **clickety-click**" and all would be well for a couple of moments.

So, back when I was a sysadmin and on the UK naming committee, which later morphed into Nominet, I registered the bofh.org.uk domain, and have been using it for coming up on 10 years now.

Which is why any phishing attempt that shows up purporting to be from `service`bofh.org.uk@ is even less likely to get me to open its attachment than usual. "Listen squire, if you were the real 'Bofh management' I would have been disconnnected from the internet and lying bleeding in a ditch already."

I think the best bit is "Bofh Antivirus" concept. Here's the mail for your reading pleasure:
