Exercise 4 of chromatic's <a href="http://www.wgz.org/chromatic/writeyourlife/">Write Your Life</a> tells me to:

> Create a new invention, change your life circumstances, or somehow write away a difficult or time-consuming task. First define the problem, show how it affects you, and then invent it away.

But I'm not going to do that, exactly, because I already did it.
