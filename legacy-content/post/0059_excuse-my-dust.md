So, typo, the tool this runs on is undergoing some major (and good) changes. The only catch is, my deployment script consists of 'doing it by hand and forgetting stuff', which isn't ideal.

Hopefully, next time there's a change I'll have a sensible deployment scheme in place (it won't have to be very sensible to be more sensible than the one I have at the moment).
