So, in my quest to get Amazon links working I've been spending time hanging out on the \#rubyonrails irc channel asking dumb questions and generally liking the place, when someone[1] asked "Are you the famous Perl Programmer, Piers Cawley?"

What's the right answer? Sadly, I wasn't shameless enough to simply answer "Yes."

Coincidence is good isn't it? A couple of hours earlier, I'd been reading [Mary Branscombe](http://www.livejournal.com/users/marypcb/) on the talk [Danny O'Brien](http://www.oblomovka.com/) gave at this year's OpenTech about 'geek micro celebrity' or some such topic. How very odd.

[1] I don't log my IRC, so I can't remember who. Sorry.
