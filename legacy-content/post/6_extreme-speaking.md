Somewhat to my own surprise, I'm at [YAPC::Europe](http://yapc.mongueurs.fr) in Paris. I pitched up to the early birds session and offered a talk if they'd had any people pull out and it turned out that they had -- Ronan Oger was due to give a half day tutorial on <a href="http://yapc.mongueurs.net/yapc/talk/?tid=46">SVG-based GUIs</a> on the first afternoon of the conference, but he wasn't going to make it in time, so the organizers swapped his talk with Dave Cross's talk on <a href="http://yapc.mongueurs.net/yapc/talk/?tid=26">Tieing and Overloading Objects in Perl</a>.

Dave's talk is an hour shorter than Ronan's, so Simon Wistow, Richard Clamp and me offered three 20 minute talks to fill the gaps.

There was a catch; all the talks I'd taken to America had been aimed at 40 minutes and for the life of me I couldn't see how to make them any shorter.

"Never mind," I thought, "I can waffle about Pixie or refactoring or something, or if all else fails I can brush off 12 Step Perl and get my audience to do at least half of the work for me.

This was my plan, but then I had this idea for a cunning trick to make Perl's method inheritance system a little more sane.
