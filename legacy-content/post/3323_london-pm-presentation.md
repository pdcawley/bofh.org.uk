Back in (crikey) February, I gave a talk at the London Perl Mongers' technical meeting about Moose for Ruby Programmers and wrote it up [here](http://www.bofh.org.uk/2009/02/22/moose-for-ruby-programmers). Mike Whittaker was in the front row of the audience with his iPhone and, a couple of minutes in, started a voice recording and gave me a copy.

So... finally... I've taken the time I should have been using to write another article for [The H](http://h-online.com) and wrestled the slides and the audio into something like sync and uploaded the results to [Vimeo](http://www.vimeo.com/) for your viewing pleasure.
