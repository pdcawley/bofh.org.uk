If you asked me to name my favourite radio and TV comedy, the odds are very good that Geoffrey Perkins had a hand in most of them. When I found his [obituary](http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2008/sep/01/television2) in this morning's Guardian I felt almost physically winded. I never met him, I don't know anyone who did, but he was someone who helped to make the world a pleasanter place to be in. My thoughts are with his family and friends, who are no doubt even more gutted than I am.
