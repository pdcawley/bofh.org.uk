So, today's the first day of YAPC::Belfast, my birthday and the third day of my teacher training course. I'd **really** like to be in Belfast, but I wouldn't have missed what I actually did for the world.

I'd tell you all about it, but I'm still not sure what the rules are about confidentiality of pupils and stuff so, until I've found that out I won't be writing about that stuff. Except to say that I'm finding it really exciting -- scary, but definitely exciting.

Next up: sushi.

Here's hoping YAPC::Europe's during the school holidays next year.
