Browsing through my logs, as you do, I've noticed that the essay I wrote over two years ago on [The Fine Art of Complexity Management](http://www.bofh.org.uk/articles/2003/08/01/the-fine-art-of-complexity-management) is still showing up in the top 10 hits. In fact, at the moment, it's the second most popular non-feed, none front-page article on the site. What's weird is that, most of the links to it that I can find on Google point to a no-longer accessible version of the site.

I was thinking about the power of the Just Story as I read [this thread](http://lesscode.org/2005/10/05/37signals-we-have-a-problem/) on Alex Bunardzic's excellent [lesscode](http://lesscode.org/) blog. In the article, Alex takes [37signals](http://www.37signals.com/) to task for, essentially, choosing the wrong Just Story for [Writeboard](http://writeboard.com/), their new, free, collaborative writing environment.
