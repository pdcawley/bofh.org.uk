The weather recently has been remarkably muggy, so Iâ€™ve been keeping my office window open while Iâ€™m working. Which is all very well, but weâ€™re trying to keep the cats in, so I have to keep the office door closed. Of course, it shouldnâ€™t be too much of a worry, weâ€™re on the first floor (2nd floor if youâ€™re American) and surely the cats wouldnâ€™t be so stupid as to go leaping out of the window. Still, best to keep the door shut.

You can tell where this is going canâ€™t you?
