Listen to [this](http://www.squeezy.fsnet.co.uk/spiers_boden/Bold%20Sir%20Rylas.mp3). You'll not regret it.

Whee! John Spiers and Jon Boden have finally made an album (<cite>Songs</cite>) that sounds as good as they do live. Not that <cite>Through and Through</cite> and <cite>Bellow</cite> are bad albums, it's just that their playing has improved somewhat since they were recorded. On stage, Jon and John play with an almost telepathic level of communication. Songs captures that magic.
