If you've eaten with me, you might be aware that I'm not a big one for chili heat. I don't mind it, but you won't find me chopping up the Scotch Bonnets for a mole or ladling out the chili oil in a Chinese restaurant.

If you'd suggested that I would cook something that involved 3 *tablespoons* full of chili oil, complete with the sludge of seeds from the bottom of the jar, in a dish for two people I would have thought you had gone mad. If you had then suggested that I'd love the resulting dish with a passion that made me want to rush off and blog about it...
