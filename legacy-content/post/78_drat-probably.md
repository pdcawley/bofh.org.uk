I've been unemployed (apart from the aborted teacher training course and the Perl 6 Summaries) for far too long now.

I'm starting to get used to it.

Today I interviewed with Sunderland University for a Systems Manager job. The money was decent, the work looked interesting, the interview was enjoyable.

I didn't get the job. No real surprise there I think -- they interviewed at least one other person who had more current experience with their specific hardware than me.

I have to confess that a small part of me is delighted. The rest of me is running around like a headless chicken and screaming "I need a job! I need a job! I need a job!" (No, I don't know how a headless chicken is supposed to scream. If you know a better simile I'd be happy to give it a good home in this entry.)

If you're in a position to offer a job to an experienced Perl programmer, fledgling Ruby programmer, part time summary writer, half-decent photographer and inveterate Java hater who doesn't want to move back to London, thank you very much then I'd be delighted to hear from you at <a href="mailto:pdcawley@bofh.org.uk">pdcawley@bofh.org.uk</a>. Our operators are standing by.
