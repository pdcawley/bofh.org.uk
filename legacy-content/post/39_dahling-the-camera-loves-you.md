So, I'm catching up with [NTK](http://www.ntk.net/) and notice my name in one of the [links](http://qwer.org/preferthetermalphaspazzos.html), which is weird. So, being curious I follow the link and it's the video that got made at EuroFoo this year, for which I was interviewed.

Now, I know it's a truism that a camera adds to ones weight, so I was prepared for looking like an incredibly rare beached bearded whale, but I didn't realise I was quite so hyper. Bear in mind that this is me at the end of a conference, and I'm uncaffeinated as always.

So, am I really like that? I have the feeling I'm going to have to seriously slow down if I'm going to be attempting to teach maths to impressionable young pupils...
