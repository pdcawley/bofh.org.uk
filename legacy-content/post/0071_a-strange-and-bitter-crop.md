There's a print hanging above the reception desk at the place where I'm temping. It depicts a line of silhouettes of poplars. It bears the title <cite asin="B000077JRZ">Southern Trees</cite>

I'm finding it very hard to resist the urge to add a couple of bodies hanging from one of them. I wonder if the artist and whoever bought this print realised what they were evoking.
