I know! It's been a while. But we're in! I have baked, and it was
good. There's still a ton of stuff to do (plumbing, mostly) but the
really important bits of kit are all in place and looking good.

We celebrated getting in by turning one of the decks up as high as it
would go and making lots of pizzas and a few loaves of bread.

*** The story so far…

In my [[/2016/11/11/taking-stock/][last entry]] (over a year ago, argh! Gill is /much/ better) the
oven and all my kit were still in my garage, up on blocks waiting for
Dad to build an A-frame so we could winch it up and assemble it. Which
happened, and we managed to get one section of oven up onto the base.
And there we stopped because the fully assembled oven is very tall, and
the A-frame isn't tall enough to accommodate a fully assembled oven +
the winch + space for the straps (and my garage roof isn't high enough
to accommodate a sufficently tall A-frame). Still, it allowed us to
start in on prEocess of breaking the heads of very old brass
machine screws and generally failing to get the oven beds out where
they could be cleaned. This was frustrating, but it's not like I was
unused to frustration.

Meanwhile, the bakehouse site moved again. We had thought it would be
a relatively easy (and thus cheap) matter to run the necessary 3-phase
power to the space, but it turns out there wasn't quite enough power
going to the building to support what we needed. That would mean a new
substation and some very expensive cable laying. So it wasn't going to
fly. Luckily, there is also an old cafe in the yard. And it already has 3
phase, and enough 3 phase at that. So we set about making that into a
bakehouse. A lick of paint; some new flooring; wider, taller doorways
so we could get the oven in. Minor stuff like that.

By now we're up to late spring of 2017. I'd given up on trying to
renovate the decks myself, so I got onto Martin Passey at [[http://becketts.co.uk/][Becketts]] and
arranged for them to sort out the electrics and replace the rusty
steel beds with ceramic ones instead, which are generally reckoned to
be the best choice if you want to make 'hearth' breads on the oven
floor. We just needed to work out how to get the oven from Doncaster
to Heywood.

Guess what? It wasn't straightforward.

When we picked up my oven from the Isle of Wight, we'd got it into a
large Luton bodied van with a tail lift, and it was kind of fine. I
suppose I could have hired another one, roped in a few volunteers and
driven it over myself, but the fact that we'd partially assembled the
oven was going to make that rather trickier than it could have been.
Disassembling it was going to be tricky too - after we got the straps
out from the top decks when we'd assembled it, we discovered we'd been
very lucky indeed, and the strap had /very/ nearly broken.

The best option was to get a flatbed truck with a Hiab or similar
hydraulic crane which would make short work of getting the oven up
onto the truck and off to be fettled. But the access (up a 10 foot
wide back lane) proved daunting. All the haulage companies I talked to
took one look at it and backed away, muttering darkly and making the
sign of the cross. "Get a bunch of strong Polish lads to carry it down
the alley and stick it on the back of a truck" was the best (but very
unofficial) suggestion. Not ideal.

So now it's July and I'm chatting to a fellow guest at my brother's
silver wedding anniversary about my shipping woes. "You want to talk
to Dan!" he said.

"Dan?"

"Yeah, [[http://www.danpunchard.co.uk/][Dan Punchard]]. He's great, he's moved a couple of lathes for me
with some really tight access."

"Thanks!"

My informant was not wrong. Dan was brilliant. We exchanged a few
emails and photos of the access and /bang/ the oven was off into the
tender loving care of Becketts for its electrical fettling and new
floors. And soon the money was flowing out of my savings as I bought a
new spiral mixer, wire cooling baskets, steel work table, scales (both
electronic for weighing ingredients into the mixer and a balance
scale, which is /still/ the fastest way of scaling dough when you
divide it), lots of [[https://www.bakerybits.co.uk/bakery-equipment/proving-baskets-and-cloths/wicker-baskets/heavy-duty.html][bannetons]] (probably not enough) from Bakery Bits,
workwear, flour, wire shelving, and a bewildering amount of janitorial
bits and bobs from [[https://nisbets.co.uk/][Nisbets]]. Fettling the oven wasn't exactly cheap,
but wow, do those baskets add up!

*** It's arrived, and it fits

On the 8th of December last year I sent mail Martin some mail with the
subject "It's arrived, and it fits!" and over the next couple of weeks
the rest of the stuff I needed to bake arrived and, on the 20th of
December, I fired up the mixer for batch of 16 loaves and what proved
to be far too many pizza doughballs.

On Friday 21st of December, I pulled my first loaves out of my ~40
year old oven, and /damn/, but they were good.

[[./back-to-the-bakehouse/first-loaf.jpg]]

*** What next?

    Of course, no enterprise like this is ever finished, here's a
    selection from my to do list.


**** Plumbing
     A bigger sink! Water near the scale so I'm not carrying buckets
     back and forth! A handwash basin!

**** Qualifications
     Environmental Health Officers do like you to have a certificate
     to show you're not a complete moron when it comes to hygiene.
     Breadmaking is relatively low risk because everything gets so
     very hot during the cooking process, but even so.

**** Refrigeration
     Right now everything's at the ambient temperature, which can mean
     staying in the bake house until the early hours in order to get
     the loaves into the oven when they're perfectly proved. A better
     approach would be to stick the dough into a retarder (big
     fridge, racked for standard bakers' sheet pans) and bake them
     first thing in the morning after a decent night's sleep. I have a
     retarder, but transport is annoyingly tricky because it's 2m
     tall, and should ideally be transported vertically too.

**** Fitness
     Right now, I can just about cope with two bakes a week, but if
     I'm going to actually make money at this, I'm going to need to be
     able to manage more. Hopefully, as I bake it'll improve my
     fitness, so as demand grows I'll be able to meet it.

**** Marketing
     Oh boy, do I suck at marketing? Still, the product is good and
     there's nobody else in the local area making this sort of bread,
     so I have a few advantages. I still haven't made a Loafery
     website though. At least I have the loafery.co.uk domain.

**** Online ordering
     If I can get people ordering online, I can use that to produce
     production schedules, and generally have a better idea of how
     much to make on each bake day, which help minimise any wasted
     bread. With two bakes done this year, I've sold every loaf - I'd
     like to keep that up.

*** In the next bakehouse diary...
    I'll talk about how a bake goes and the process of developing an
    initial range of products, sourcing flour and other ingredients
    and hopefully some news about online ordering.

* DONE Asshole Free Devil's Advocacy :philosophy:blether:

  So, you want to play Devil's Advocate, but you're afraid you might come across as a bit (or a lot) of an asshole? Here's some suggestions for how to avoid that.

#+hugo: more

** Maybe don't?

   Seriously, why does the Devil need an advocate? If you want to play DA because you think the position you want to argue has some merit, then argue the position honestly and own it. If it doesn't survive the discussion (or is shouted down), then "Ah right, I hadn't thought of that, you're right" or words to that effect and file that position in your memory as a bad one (along with the skeleton of /why/ it's bad). Nothing wrong with holding strong opinions, the thing that's bad is holding onto them if they're shown to be bad. If the group you're talking with just shouts you down and doesn't convince you that your position is a bad one, maybe find a different group? Or agree with them to steer clear of that topic.

   What's really intellectually dishonest is to say "I was only playing Devil's Advocate!" after an idea has been shot down. I'm sure your intentions are entirely honorable, but what if they weren't? Say you genuinely held that the best thing to do with the children of the poor was to turn them into cheap and delicious meals for the richest in society. Say you advanced this position to your friends and were utterly appalled by the idea. Then maybe you'd try to distance yourself from it by saying "Whoah! Guys[fn:1]! I was only playing Devil's Advocate!"

   When I hear someone playing that card, how am I supposed to distinguish between the well-meaning "There is this argument I've come across that I'm not sure I agree with, but it maybe has some merit and I don't know how I'd argue convincingly against it" types and the assholes who were flying a kite? Maybe the non-assholes will have friends who'll tell me that "They might seem like a bit of an arse, but they're not really." I've been that guy, and I don't want to be him again. Why is it okay for me to load the work of explaining that I'm not dickhead onto my friends rather than just not acting like a dickhead in the first place? Eventually, friends get tired. Eventually they'll shift to "Yeah, I know he seems like an ass, and he kind of is, but..." and then one day, they won't be your friends any more.


** Be up front

   Before you introduce the idea you want to play Devil's advocate for, say something like "D'you mind if I play Devil's advocate for a moment?" And when the group tells you "Yes, we do mind. Why help the devil?" listen to them. If it's genuinely that you've heard some argument that on the face of it seems repugnant, but you can't find a hole in it, then say as much: "What's wrong with this idea? Clearly feeding poor babies to the 1% is utterly repellant, but I can't find an effective counterargument."

   Don't keep doing it, mind, or you'll start looking like the kite flying asshole again.

* Footnotes

[fn:1]​ I know. But the kind of people who make this move in an argument are usually the kind of people who'd address a mixed group of folk as "guys".
