We need to know how much starter to mix tonight. We know that we need 0.63 kg of dough for each loaf, so that’s a total of 5.04 kg of Basic White Sour. The formula for Basic White Sour makes a total of (1.10 + 1.80 + 0.06 + 2.00=4.96 mathrm{kg}) of dough. So we need to multiply each quantity in that formula by the weight of dough we need divided by the total weight of the recipe ((5.04/4.96=1.016)). This is straightforward enough for flour, water and salt, which are basic ingredients, but we’ll need to do a similar calculation to work out how much flour and water we’ll need to make (1.016 × 1.8=1.829 mathrm{kg}) of starter. You can see how this might become a little tedious.</p>\n<p>If I were going to be doing these calculations by hand, it would definitely pay me to normalize my intermediate formulae so they all made a total of 1 kg of stuff. But screw that, we have a computer, so we can make it do the work.</p>\n<p>I’m going to simplify things a little (the real database understands about dates, and we need to know a little more about recipes, products and ingredients than will fit in the <code>recipe_item</code> table that describes the graph) but this should give you an idea of the recursive queries that drive production planning.</p>\n<p>Let’s introduct a <code>production_order</code> table, where we stash our orders<br />\n:</p>\nproduct\nquantity\nSmall White Wild\n5\nSmall Seedy Malt\n5\n\n<p>And that’s all we need to fire off a recursive query<br />\n.</p>\n<pre><code><span>WITH</span> <span>RECURSIVE</span> po(product, quantity) <span>AS</span> (\n    <span>SELECT</span> <span>'Small White Wild'</span>, <span>5</span>\n  <span>UNION</span>\n    <span>SELECT</span> <span>'Large White Wild'</span>, <span>5</span>\n), rw(recipe, weight) <span>AS</span> (\n    <span>SELECT</span> recipe, <span>sum</span>(amount)\n      <span>FROM</span> bakehouse.recipe_item\n  <span>GROUP</span> <span>BY</span> recipe\n), job(product, ingredient, quantity) <span>AS</span> (\n    <span>SELECT</span> po.product,\n           ri.ingredient,\n           po.quantity <span>*</span> ri.amount\n      <span>FROM</span> po\n      <span>JOIN</span> bakehouse.recipe_item ri <span>ON</span> po.product <span>=</span> ri.recipe\n      <span>JOIN</span> rw <span>ON</span> ri.recipe <span>=</span> rw.recipe\n  <span>UNION</span>\n    <span>SELECT</span> job.ingredient, ri.ingredient, job.quantity <span>*</span> ri.amount <span>/</span> rw.weight\n      <span>FROM</span> job\n      <span>join</span> bakehouse.recipe_item ri <span>on</span> job.ingredient <span>=</span> ri.recipe\n      <span>join</span> rw <span>on</span> job.ingredient <span>=</span> rw.recipe\n)\n<span>SELECT</span> product formula, ingredient, ROUND(<span>sum</span>(quantity),<span>2</span>) quantity <span>from</span> job <span>group</span> <span>by</span> job.product, job.ingredient <span>order</span> <span>by</span> formula;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Which gives the following result:</p>\nformula\ningredient\nquantity\nBasic White Sour\nSea salt\n0.09\nBasic White Sour\nWater\n1.72\nBasic White Sour\nMother\n2.81\nBasic White Sour\nOrganic white flour\n3.13\nLarge White Wild\nBasic White Sour\n4.65\nMother\nOrganic white flour\n1.56\nMother\nWater\n1.25\nSmall White Wild\nBasic White Sour\n3.10\n\n<p>A quick sanity check seems to show this is correct (we’re making 7.75kg of Basic White Sour, which tallies with the weights needed to make the loaves).<br />\nSo what’s going on in the query? In SQL, <code>WITH</code> is a way of giving names to your intermediate results, akin to <code>let</code> in a Lisp. We fake up a table to hold our production orders (<code>po</code>) and the <code>rw</code> clause is totals the weights of all our recipes (in the real database, it’s a view). The magic really starts to happen when you use the <code>WITH RECURSIVE</code> form. With <code>RECURSIVE</code> in play, the last query is treated differently. Instead of being a simple two part <code>UNION</code> what happens is that we first run:</p>\n<pre><code><span>SELECT</span> po.product, ri.ingredient, po.quantity <span>*</span> ri.amount\n  <span>FROM</span> po\n  <span>JOIN</span> bakehouse.recipe_item ri <span>on</span> po.product <span>=</span> ri.recipe\n  <span>JOIN</span> rw <span>on</span> ri.recipe <span>=</span> rw.recipe\n</code></pre>\n<p>and call the results <code>job</code> and then run the second query, adding any extra rows generated to the results, and repeating that query until the result set stops growing. If we didn’t have <code>WITH RECURSIVE</code> available, and we knew the maximum depth of recursion we would need, we could fake it by making a bunch of intermediate clauses in our <code>WITH</code>. In fact, until I worked out how <code>WITH RECURSIVE</code> works, that’s exactly what I did.</p>\n<p>Have you spotted the mistake? I didn’t, until a few bakes when horribly wrong.</p>\n<p>Here’s what happens when we have an order for 3 small loaves and two large ones</p>\nformula\ningredient\nquantity\nBasic White Sour\nSea salt\n0.02\nBasic White Sour\nWater\n0.41\nBasic White Sour\nMother\n0.68\nBasic White Sour\nOrganic white flour\n0.75\nLarge White Wild\nBasic White Sour\n1.86\nMother\nOrganic white flour\n0.38\nMother\nWater\n0.30\nSmall White Wild\nBasic White Sour\n1.86\n\n<p>We’re only making 1.86 kg of dough? What’s going on?</p>\n<p>It turns out that the way a <code>UNION</code> works is akin to doing <code>SELECT DISTINCT</code> on the combined table, so it selects only unique rows. When two orders end up requiring exactly the same amount of the ‘same’ dough, they get smashed together and we lose half the weight. This is not ideal.<br />\nI fixed it by adding a ‘path’ to the query, keeping track of how we arrived at a particular formula.
